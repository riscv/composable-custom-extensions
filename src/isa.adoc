= ISA Specification

This section contains the ISA specification for RISC-V Composable
Custom Extensions.

There are two ISA specifications described in the specification, `Zcx`
and `Zcxmulti`.  The `Zcx` extension includes all the necessary base
functionality, including unprivileged opcode multiplexing and state
management, as well as privileged access control.  The `Zcx` extension
supports a single context per composable custom extension.  The
`Zcxmulti` extension depends on `Zcx` and provides the necessary CSRs
and behavior to support multiple contexts per extension.
